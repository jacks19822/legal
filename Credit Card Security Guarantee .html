<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Shopping online at AtBatt.com is safe and secure. None of our customers have ever reported fraudulent use of their credit cards as a result of shopping with us. In fact, due to our secure server SSL (secure socket layer) encryption technology, shopping online with us is much safer than using your credit card at a regular store or restaurant. Our secure server software encrypts all of the information that you give, ensuring that your transactions with us stay private and secure. Every purchase you make at AtBatt.com is backed by our security guarantee - if any unauthorized use of your credit card occurs as a result of your purchases with us, notify your credit card company in accordance with its rules and procedures. If, through no fault of your own, the credit card provider finds credit card fraud but does not completely waive your liability, AtBatt.com will reimburse you for the remaining liability up to a maximum of US$50.00. This guarantee applies to credit card purchases made using AtBatt.com's secure server. Furthermore, you can be assured that the information you give us is private. We do not sell, rent or share information about our customers.</span></p>
